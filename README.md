Each service is created using **Node.js** and **Express.js**. Data for each service is held in  **Mongo** database. 

Async, event-based communication between services (**NATS Streaming Server**)

The entire app is deployed in **Docker** containers executed in a **Kubernetes** cluster. 

Finally, almost all of the code is written with **Typescript**.
